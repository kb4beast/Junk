Hey Team,

From day one — even back at our first meet & greet — I’ve said the same thing: I need and want this to be a team where people feel comfortable, speak up, share what they know, and know they’ve got our support. No walls, no weirdness — just a solid, open vibe. That’s the culture I’m dreaming of. And I see you three as a big part of it. You’ve been consistently crushing it, and it’s clear you’ve got the skills and mindset that others on the team look up to.

That’s why I’m reaching out to say: it’s time to take it to the next level.

We’re now needing to deliver stuff end-to-end in full vertical slices that touch:
UI, BFF, APIs, Service Registry, CI/CD, Databases, Cloud infra on PCF, complex backend stuff like the Bulk Processor, etc.
And no one can deliver that all by themselves.

But together? You three can lead the charge from offshore.

Here’s what I’m hoping for:

Start stepping in as technical drivers. Be the ones that help connect the dots, coordinate dependencies, and — most importantly — share what you know. If there’s a gap, don’t wait. Be the one to drop a quick call on the calendar, have random ad hoc meetings at whiteboards or desks, or even do an old-fashioned “watering hole” conversation. Host a mini session. Even a 15-minute walk-through goes a long way.

I’m not asking for perfection — we all know there’s no such thing (even I have carry-over and will admit I don’t always plan the perfect sprint). But I am asking for us to keep getting better and learning from our mistakes.

More than perfection, I need initiative. Initiative doesn’t mean setting up formal meetings or doing extra ceremonies. It means:
Don’t just show up to check boxes — be excited enough about what you’re working on to help get it to prod fast. That includes working with other offshore folks to sort out contracts for UI/BFF/API/database and the remaining steps to hit prod.

And hey — if you don’t know what’s next, ask questions. You’ve already got the trust and credibility. This is just the next evolution.

I’ve got your back on all of it. And honestly, I’m excited to see what happens when you start running with this.

Let’s make this team one that sets the standard. You in?

– Brian
