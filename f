Hey [Agent 1], [Agent 2], and [Agent 3],

From day one — even back at our first meet & greet — I’ve said the same thing: I want this to be a team where people feel comfortable, speak up, share what they know, and know they’ve got support. No walls, no weirdness — just a solid, open vibe. That’s the culture I’m building, and I see you three as a big part of it.

You’ve been consistently crushing it, and it’s clear you’ve got the skills and mindset that others on the team look up to. That’s why I’m reaching out to say: it’s time to take it to the next level.

We’re now delivering stuff end-to-end — full vertical slices that touch:

UI

BFF

APIs

Service Registry

CI/CD

Databases

Cloud infra on PCF

Even complex backend stuff like the Bulk Processor

And no one can deliver that solo. But together? You three can lead the charge.

Here’s what I’m hoping for:
Start stepping in as technical drivers. Be the ones that help connect the dots, coordinate dependencies, and — most importantly — share what you know. If there’s a gap, don’t wait. Be the one to drop a quick call on the calendar. Host a mini session. Even a 15-minute walk-through goes a long way.

I’m not asking for perfection — just movement. Initiative. You’ve already got the trust and credibility. This is just the next evolution.

I’ve got your back on all of it. And honestly, I’m excited to see what happens when you start running with it.

Let’s make this team one that sets the standard. You in?

– Brian
